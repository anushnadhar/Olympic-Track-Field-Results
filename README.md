# Olympic Track & Field Results


## About the Project

The Olympic Track & Field Results project on Kaggle is a dataset-focused initiative that provides historical data on Olympic track and field events. It includes comprehensive details such as athlete names, nationalities, events, performance metrics, and medals won. The dataset allows users to explore trends, analyze performance patterns, and visualize insights across different Olympic years, aiding in data analysis and storytelling. 
It is a valuable resource for sports enthusiasts, data analysts, and machine learning practitioners to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

## Tableau Visualization

I utilized Tableau to create a visual representation of the data. In this one, I have tried to work around with Tableau Dashboards.


## How to Use

To view the visualization, follow these steps:
1. Download the Tableau workbook from the repository.
2. Open Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
3. Open the downloaded workbook to interact with the visualization.
